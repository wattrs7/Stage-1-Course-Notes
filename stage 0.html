     <h1> INTERNET BASICS </h1>
      The web consists of personal computers <br>
      Computer Servers <br>
      and the internet that connects them using languages like HTML and HTTP<br>
    <h2>HTML</h2>

        HTML is a language used to create web pages <br>
        HTML uses tags to instruct the computer to perfrom certain tasks<br>
        Tags can be inline or block <br>
        <p>The difference is that block tags create a virtual space with height and width that text or elements fit into. Inline tags extend as far right as needed. </p>

    <div>
      <span style="color:blue">list of inline tags</span>
      <p>&lt; span &gt; for spans of data </p>
      <p>&lt; br &gt; creates a page break</p>
      <p>&lt; b &gt; bolds text</p>
      <p>&lt; em &gt; italics text </p>
      <p>&lt; img &gt; inserts an image</p>
      <p>&lt; a &gt; inserts a link...requires usage of a reference</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style="color:blue">list of block tags </span>
      <p>&lt; p &gt; creates a paragraph</p>
      <p>&lt; div &gt; creats a division </p>
      <p>&lt; h1 &gt; creates a header </p>
    </div>

    <h2>STRUCTURE</h2>
      Using indents helps to organize blocks of information.<br>
      Specific data is further indented and general data is indented less <br>
      HTML files should contain a head and a body

      <p>
        Udacity likes to teach users HTML as part of programing because it is
        fun and visual.  It offers immediate feedback to new programers.

    <h2>Difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <div class="HTML vs CSS">
        <div class="HTML">
        HTML discribes what will be on the screen and where it will appear
        </div>
        <div class="CSS">
        CSS describes the style of each element and how it will appear on the page
        </div>
        <span>HTML will place a box on the page and fill it with data, CSS will
          describe how the data is desplayed.  IE changing font, color, etc.</span>
        </div>

    <h2>Development Fundementals</h2>
      <div class="Googles Developer Tool">
        <h3>Accessing Googles Developer Tool</h3>
          <span>This tool allows users to view the code that is behind websites</span>
          <span>It can be useful to students for studying site organization and functionality</span>

        <div class "developer tool access image">
          <p>
            You can look at the HTML code of any website by using the google devloper
            tool.  This can be accessed by the below menu

      <div class="HTML Organization ">
        <h3>HTML Sturcture</h3>
          <div class="Boxes">
            <span>HTML element appear as boxes on the page </span>
            <span>How the box behaves is described by the element(s) attatched to it </span>
            <span>Elements can contain other elements and so boxes can contain other boxes</span>
          </div>

          </div class = "Visual Help">
          <p>
            Because Boxes can contain boxes and those boxes can contain more boxes analyzing code can become complicated.
            Sometimes it helps to draw out the elements in a "BRANCHING" flow chart.  This is also helpful when
            starting a website with a basic graphical template.
